# Phase 2: Unified Memory System Architecture

## Overview

The Phase 2 memory system provides a unified, high-performance memory management solution for DotCompute with advanced features including lazy transfer optimization, power-of-2 bucket allocation, and comprehensive performance benchmarking.

## Key Components

### 1. UnifiedBuffer<T>

**Location**: `src/DotCompute.Memory/UnifiedBuffer.cs`

A unified buffer that manages both host and device memory with lazy transfer optimization.

**Key Features**:
- **Lazy Transfer Optimization**: Only transfers data when actually needed
- **Memory State Tracking**: Tracks host/device memory states and dirty flags
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All operations are thread-safe with proper locking
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in access tracking and performance statistics

**Memory States**:
- `Uninitialized`: No memory allocated
- `HostOnly`: Only host memory allocated
- `DeviceOnly`: Only device memory allocated
- `HostAndDevice`: Both host and device memory allocated

**Usage Example**:
```csharp
using var buffer = new UnifiedBuffer<float>(memoryManager, pool, 1024);

// Allocate host memory
await buffer.AllocateHostMemoryAsync();

// Get host span for writing
var hostSpan = await buffer.GetHostSpanAsync();
hostSpan[0] = 123.45f;

// Mark host as dirty and get device memory (triggers lazy sync)
buffer.MarkHostDirty();
var deviceMemory = await buffer.GetDeviceMemoryAsync();
```

### 2. MemoryPool<T>

**Location**: `src/DotCompute.Memory/MemoryPool.cs`

A high-performance memory pool using power-of-2 bucket allocation strategy.

**Key Features**:
- **Power-of-2 Buckets**: Efficient allocation with minimal fragmentation
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent-safe rent/return operations
- **Memory Pressure Handling**: Automatically releases memory under pressure
- **Reuse Optimization**: Maximizes buffer reuse for improved performance

**Bucket Strategy**:
- Minimum bucket size: 64 elements
- Maximum bucket size: 16M elements
- 24 total buckets (log2(16M) - log2(64) + 1)
- Maximum 8 pooled arrays per bucket

**Usage Example**:
```csharp
using var pool = new MemoryPool<float>(memoryManager);

// Rent a buffer
using var owner = pool.Rent(1000); // Returns 1024-element buffer (next power of 2)

// Use the buffer
owner.Memory.Span[0] = 42.0f;

// Buffer is automatically returned to pool on dispose
```

### 3. IUnifiedMemoryManager

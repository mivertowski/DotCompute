/// <summary>
/// The exception that is thrown when memory allocation fails after all recovery attempts have been exhausted.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This exception is typically thrown by memory management systems when they are unable to
/// satisfy a memory allocation request even after performing various recovery strategies
/// such as garbage collection, defragmentation, and emergency cleanup operations.
/// It indicates that the system has reached a critical memory state where no additional
/// memory can be made available.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// try
/// {
///     var buffer = memoryManager.AllocateBuffer(requestedSize);
/// }
/// catch (MemoryAllocationException ex)
/// {
///     logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to allocate {Size} bytes after recovery attempts", requestedSize);
///     // Handle the allocation failure gracefully
/// }
/// </code>

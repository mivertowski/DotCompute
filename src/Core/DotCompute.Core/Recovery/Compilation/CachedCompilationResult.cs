/// Represents a cached compilation result that can be reused to avoid recompiling

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Cached compilation results are used to improve performance by avoiding
/// redundant compilation operations. The cache includes:
/// - A hash of the kernel for fast lookup and validation
/// - The original source code for verification
/// - The compilation options that resulted in success
/// - Expiration tracking to ensure cache freshness
/// 
/// The cache is particularly valuable for:
/// - Kernels that are compiled multiple times with the same parameters
/// - Fallback scenarios where a previously successful configuration can be reused
/// - Reducing compilation overhead in development and testing scenarios
/// 
/// Cached results include expiration times to ensure that outdated entries
/// are not used when the underlying compilation environment may have changed.

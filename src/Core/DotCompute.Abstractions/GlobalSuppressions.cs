// CA1720: Identifier contains type name
// Justification: 'Pointer' is the semantically correct name for a property returning a pointer.
// The property returns an actual pointer (T*) and renaming would reduce clarity.

// CA1720: Identifier contains type name for enum members
// Justification: These enum members represent actual data types (Single, Double) in kernel type systems.
// Renaming would break the semantic mapping to underlying hardware types.
[assembly: SuppressMessage("Naming", "CA1720:Identifier 'Single' contains type name", Justification = "Enum member represents the single-precision floating-point type; renaming would reduce clarity", Scope = "member", Target = "~F:DotCompute.Abstractions.Interfaces.Kernels.KernelDataType.Single")]

// CA1721: Property name confusing with method name
// Justification: LaunchConfiguration property provides direct access to configuration,
// while GetLaunchConfiguration() method computes/creates a new instance with additional logic.
// This follows the common pattern of property for field access and method for computation.
[assembly: SuppressMessage("Naming", "CA1721:The property name 'LaunchConfiguration' is confusing given the existence of method 'GetLaunchConfiguration'", Justification = "Property provides direct access; method performs computation - intentional design pattern", Scope = "member", Target = "~P:DotCompute.Abstractions.Kernels.KernelArguments.LaunchConfiguration")]

// CA1724: Type name conflicts with namespace
// Justification: The 'Telemetry' class represents telemetry data and naturally belongs in
// the Telemetry namespace. This is a common and acceptable pattern in .NET.

// CA2217: Do not mark enums with FlagsAttribute

// IL2026: RequiresUnreferencedCode warnings

// VSTHRD200: Avoid "Async" suffix for non-async methods

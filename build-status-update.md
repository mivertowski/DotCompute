# Build Status Update

## Progress Report

### Current Status
- **Error Count**: 202 (increased from 200)
- **Working Components**: SimpleExample sample
- **AOT Status**: 3/6 core libraries compatible

### ✅ Success Stories

#### SimpleExample Sample
- **Status**: Builds and runs successfully
- **Performance**: Vector addition completed in 19ms
- **Verification**: Results verified successfully
- **Implication**: Core compute functionality is working

#### AOT Compatible Libraries
1. **DotCompute.Abstractions** - Successfully publishes with AOT
2. **DotCompute.Core** - AOT compatible
3. **DotCompute.Memory** - AOT works with reflection warnings

### ❌ Current Blockers

#### Test Projects (All failing)
- 84 errors in DotCompute.Abstractions.Tests
- 90 errors in DotCompute.Plugins
- 20 errors in DotCompute.Generators.Tests
- All other test projects fail to build

#### Plugin Backends (AOT failures)
- DotCompute.Backends.CPU - AOT incompatible
- DotCompute.Backends.CUDA - AOT incompatible
- DotCompute.Backends.Metal - AOT incompatible

#### Sample Projects
- ✅ SimpleExample - Works!
- ❌ KernelExample - Build failed
- ❌ GettingStarted - Build failed

### Key Issues Remaining

1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Interface contract mismatches
   - FluentAssertions extension methods missing
   - Duplicate package references

2. **Package Issues**
   - Security vulnerabilities in ImageSharp
   - Version conflicts in CodeAnalysis packages

3. **AOT Compatibility**
   - Plugin system needs AOT annotations
   - Runtime compilation challenges
   - Backend plugins not AOT-ready

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize fixing test projects** - They block all testing
2. **Update vulnerable packages** immediately
3. **Add AOT annotations** to plugin infrastructure
4. **Fix duplicate package references** in test projects

### Next Monitoring Steps
- Continue checking build progress
- Monitor for test fixes by other agents
- Track AOT improvements
- Validate more samples as they become buildable

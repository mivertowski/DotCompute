Yes, another .NET blog.  
No, not another “Hello, World.” This one is about the sharp edges: graphs, GPUs, enterprise reality, and audits that actually hold up.

## What you’ll find here

* **Graph systems** — practical traversal patterns, modeling trade-offs, and production stacks with an own approach of a distributed graph system.
    
* **Enterprise architecture** — the calm, boring parts that prevent fire drills (integration seams, boundaries, and compliance-by-design).
    
* **High-performance & “silicon-agnostic” computing** — squeezing cycles with .NET across x64 and Arm64, and avoiding vendor lock-in where it hurts. ([Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
* **GPU kernels from C#** — hands-on posts with ILGPU (CUDA/OpenCL/CPU backends) and DotCompute (hardware agnostic) when Windows or Linux are the targets. Expect minimal theory, maximal code. ([ilgpu.net](https://ilgpu.net/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/mivertowski/DotCompute))
    
* **Optimization & audit systems** — feature engineering on graphs, anomaly signals, and controls that auditors don’t roll their eyes at.
    

## Why .NET for this?

Because it’s a capable, cross-platform, open-source stack that now runs well on multiple OSes and architectures—useful when you want performance *and* portability instead of a platform tattoo. ([Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## What to expect

* Short posts. Working code. Benchmarks only when they change a decision.
    
* Architecture notes from the field—less “ivory tower,” more “this didn’t break in prod.”
    
* Examples using ILGPU/DotCompute for kernels, and - teaser on - a new concept for graph work, tied back to real audit and compliance scenarios.
    

If that sounds interesting, welcome aboard. If not, that’s also data.

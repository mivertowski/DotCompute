// This file now serves as a central import for all CUDA analysis types.
// Individual types have been moved to separate files for better maintainability.

// This file is kept for backward compatibility and re-exports all types
// All types are now defined in their individual files within this Types/ directory

// This file re-exports all analysis types from individual files for backward compatibility
// All types are now properly organized in separate files within the Analysis/Types/ directory

namespace DotCompute.Backends.CUDA.Analysis.Types;

// This namespace now re-exports all analysis types for backward compatibility
// Individual types are located in their respective .cs files
// Example:
// - CoalescingAnalysis is in CoalescingAnalysis.cs
// - StridedAccessAnalysis is in StridedAccessAnalysis.cs
// - Matrix2DAccessAnalysis is in Matrix2DAccessAnalysis.cs
// - RuntimeCoalescingProfile is in RuntimeCoalescingProfile.cs
// etc.

/// <summary>
/// Simplified kernel interpreter for fallback execution when compilation fails completely.
/// Provides a compatibility layer for executing kernels in interpreted mode.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The kernel interpreter serves as the final fallback strategy when all compilation
/// attempts fail. It provides:
/// - Interpreted execution of kernel code
/// - Compatibility with the standard kernel execution interface
/// - Reduced performance but increased compatibility
/// - Graceful degradation for critical operations
///
/// While interpreted execution is significantly slower than compiled kernels,
/// it ensures that operations can continue when hardware or compiler issues
/// prevent normal compilation. This is particularly valuable for:
/// - Development and debugging scenarios
/// - Systems with limited or problematic compilation environments
/// - Critical operations that must not fail due to compilation issues
///
/// The interpreter implements IDisposable to ensure proper cleanup of
/// any resources allocated during preparation or execution.
/// </remarks>

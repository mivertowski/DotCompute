# Structs Requiring Equality Implementation

Generated by: scripts/fix-automation/04-generate-struct-equality.sh

## Instructions

For each struct below, add the following members:

```csharp
public readonly struct YourStruct : IEquatable<YourStruct>
{
    // Existing fields/properties...

    public override bool Equals(object? obj) => obj is YourStruct other && Equals(other);

    public bool Equals(YourStruct other) =>
        Field1 == other.Field1 &&
        Field2 == other.Field2;  // Add all fields

    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(Field1, Field2);

    public static bool operator ==(YourStruct left, YourStruct right) => left.Equals(right);
    public static bool operator !=(YourStruct left, YourStruct right) => !left.Equals(right);
}
```

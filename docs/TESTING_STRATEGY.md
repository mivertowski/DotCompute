### Current Coverage: ~75%

Measured using coverlet with proper configuration:

```xml
<!-- coverlet.runsettings -->
<RunSettings>
  <DataCollectionRunSettings>
    <DataCollectors>
      <DataCollector friendlyName="XPlat code coverage">
        <Configuration>
          <ExcludeByAttribute>Generated*,Obsolete*</ExcludeByAttribute>
          <ExcludeByFile>**/Tests/**,**/Shared/**</ExcludeByFile>
        </Configuration>
      </DataCollector>
    </DataCollectors>
  </DataCollectionRunSettings>
</RunSettings>
```

### Coverage by Component

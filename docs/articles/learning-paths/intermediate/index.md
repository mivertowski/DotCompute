# Intermediate Learning Path

Build on your foundational knowledge to create efficient, production-quality GPU applications.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Beginner Path](../beginner/index.md) or equivalent experience
- Understanding of GPU threads, blocks, and memory spaces
- Experience writing basic kernels

## Learning Objectives

By completing this path, you will:

1. Optimize memory allocation and transfer patterns
2. Tune kernel performance through thread configuration
3. Build multi-kernel processing pipelines
4. Implement robust error handling and debugging

## Modules

### Module 1: Memory Optimization
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes

Master memory pooling, allocation strategies, and transfer optimization.

[Start Module 1 →](memory-optimization.md)

### Module 2: Kernel Performance
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes

Optimize thread configuration, occupancy, and use profiling tools.

[Start Module 2 →](kernel-performance.md)

### Module 3: Multi-Kernel Pipelines
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes

Chain kernels efficiently and manage complex data flows.

[Start Module 3 →](multi-kernel-pipelines.md)

### Module 4: Error Handling
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes

Debug GPU code and handle failures gracefully in production.

[Start Module 4 →](error-handling.md)

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Configure memory pooling for allocation efficiency
- [ ] Profile and optimize kernel occupancy
- [ ] Build a multi-stage processing pipeline
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Debug GPU kernel issues effectively

## Next Steps

After completing this path, continue to the [Advanced Path](../advanced/index.md) to learn about Ring Kernels, synchronization, and multi-GPU programming.

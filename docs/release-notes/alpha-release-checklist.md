## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Verification Scripts
Run these scripts in order:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/build-verification.sh
chmod +x scripts/test-verification.sh  
chmod +x scripts/package-verification.sh

# Execute verification
./scripts/build-verification.sh
./scripts/test-verification.sh
./scripts/package-verification.sh
```

### Phase 2: Manual Verification
1. **Version Check**: Verify all version numbers are 0.1.0-alpha.1
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all docs reflect alpha status
3. **Sample Testing**: Run sample applications
4. **Performance Spot Check**: Basic performance validation

### Phase 3: Release Preparation
1. **Final Commit**: Commit any last-minute fixes
2. **Tag Creation**: Create annotated release tag
3. **Package Upload**: Prepare packages for distribution
4. **Release Notes**: Finalize release documentation

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Minimum Acceptance Criteria
- **Build**: 100% success rate (no build failures)
- **Core Tests**: 100% pass rate for unit tests
- **Packages**: All core packages generate successfully
- **Documentation**: Complete and accurate

### Alpha Quality Expectations
- **Functionality**: Core CPU backend fully functional
- **Performance**: Significant improvements demonstrated
- **Stability**: No critical crashes or memory leaks
- **Usability**: Basic developer experience is positive

### Known Limitations (Acceptable for Alpha)
- **CUDA Backend**: Framework complete, execution in progress
- **Metal Backend**: Basic structure, compilation pending
- **LINQ Provider**: Basic functionality, expression compilation limited
- **Hardware Tests**: May fail on systems without appropriate hardware

## 🐛 Issue Resolution

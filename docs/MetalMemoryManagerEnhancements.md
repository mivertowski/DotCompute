# MetalMemoryManager Enhanced Implementation

## Overview

The MetalMemoryManager has been significantly enhanced with sophisticated pooling features similar to CUDA, while leveraging Metal's unique advantages such as unified memory on Apple Silicon. This implementation provides production-grade memory management with advanced features for optimal performance.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Sophisticated Memory Pool (MetalMemoryPool)

- **Size-based buckets**: Power-of-2 sized pools from 256 bytes to 256MB
- **Thread-safe operations**: Uses ConcurrentBag and ConcurrentDictionary for thread safety
- **Automatic pool growth/shrinking**: Dynamic bucket management based on usage patterns
- **Fragmentation tracking**: Real-time fragmentation percentage calculation
- **Hit rate optimization**: Tracks pool hits vs misses for efficiency monitoring

### 2. Pinned Memory Support (MetalPinnedMemoryAllocator)

- **Fast CPU-GPU transfers**: Page-locked memory for optimal bandwidth
- **Allocation limits**: Maximum 64 concurrent pinned allocations of up to 256MB each
- **GCHandle management**: Proper pinning and unpinning of managed memory
- **Statistics tracking**: Monitors pinned memory usage and peak allocation

### 3. Unified Memory Optimization (MetalUnifiedMemoryBuffer)

- **Apple Silicon detection**: Automatic detection of ARM64 architecture
- **Zero-copy operations**: Direct memory access between CPU and GPU on Apple Silicon
- **Fallback support**: Standard Metal operations for discrete GPUs
- **Prefetching hints**: Memory prefetch operations for cache optimization
- **Synchronization**: Memory coherency management when needed

### 4. Memory Pressure Monitoring (MetalMemoryPressureMonitor)

- **Real-time monitoring**: Continuous memory usage tracking
- **Pressure levels**: Normal, Moderate, Warning, Critical, Emergency levels
- **Automatic responses**: Triggers cleanup and optimization based on pressure
- **macOS integration**: Framework for integrating with system memory pressure notifications
- **Statistics tracking**: Pressure events and resolution times

### 5. Advanced Memory Operations

- **P2P transfers**: Optimized GPU-to-GPU transfers using Metal's blit encoder
- **Async operations**: Fully asynchronous memory operations with cancellation support
- **Staging buffers**: Automatic staging through pinned memory for large transfers
- **Memory views**: Efficient sub-buffer views without additional allocations
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and recovery

### 6. Production-Grade Features

- **Thread safety**: All operations are thread-safe using modern .NET concurrency primitives
- **Memory leak prevention**: Proper disposal patterns and resource tracking
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logging at appropriate levels (Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error)
- **Performance optimization**: Aggressive inlining and optimized code paths
- **Statistics collection**: Detailed metrics for monitoring and debugging

using var memoryManager = new MetalMemoryManager(logger);

// Standard allocation (uses pool when possible)
var buffer = await memoryManager.AllocateAsync(4096);

// Pinned memory for fast transfers
var pinnedBuffer = await memoryManager.AllocateAsync(1024 * 1024, MemoryOptions.Pinned);

// Unified memory on Apple Silicon
var unifiedBuffer = await memoryManager.AllocateAsync(2048, MemoryOptions.Unified);

// Get comprehensive statistics
var stats = memoryManager.Statistics;
Console.WriteLine($"Hit rate: {stats.PoolHitRate:P2}");
Console.WriteLine($"Fragmentation: {stats.FragmentationPercentage:F1}%");
```

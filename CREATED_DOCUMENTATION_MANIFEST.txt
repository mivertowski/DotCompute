QUALITY METRICS
===============
- All files have proper YAML frontmatter: YES
- All files have unique UIDs: YES
- All files have progress indicators (🚧): YES
- All files have TODO placeholders: YES
- All files have "See Also" cross-references: YES
- No files created in root except required (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): YES
- Proper file organization in subdirectories: YES

NEXT ACTIONS RECOMMENDED
========================
1. Update docs/docfx.json to include phase5 directory if not already present
2. Update all toc.yml files to include new documentation entries
3. Replace TODO placeholders with actual content
4. Add code examples to all relevant files
5. Verify all cross-references work correctly
6. Test documentation builds with DocFX
7. Commit changes to repository

FILES READY FOR CONTENT DEVELOPMENT
===================================
All 34 stub files are ready for content development. Each file has:
- Proper structure with overview section
- Clear TODO placeholders indicating what content is needed
- Related "See Also" links
- Consistent formatting and styling

Development can begin immediately by replacing TODO sections with actual documentation content.

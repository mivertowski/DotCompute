### Improvement Suggestions for $component

**Current Coverage:** ${current_coverage}%
**Target Coverage:** ${target_coverage}%
**Gap:** $(echo "$target_coverage - $current_coverage" | bc -l)%

#### Action Items:
1. **Review uncovered code:** Focus on critical business logic and error paths
2. **Add edge case tests:** Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
3. **Improve test assertions:** Ensure tests validate expected behavior thoroughly
4. **Consider integration tests:** Add tests that cover component interactions

#### Common areas to improve:
- Exception handling and error paths
- Configuration and initialization code
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Async/await patterns and cancellation
- Resource cleanup and disposal patterns

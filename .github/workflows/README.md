### Workflow Environment Variables
```yaml
DOTNET_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE: 1
DOTNET_NOLOGO: true
CI: true
DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT: 1
```

## Workflow Dispatch Inputs

### Main Pipeline
- `skip_tests`: Skip test execution (boolean)
- `run_gpu_tests`: Run GPU tests on self-hosted runner (boolean)
- `create_release`: Create a release (boolean)

### Release Pipeline
- `version`: Version to release (string)
- `prerelease`: Mark as pre-release (boolean)

## Test Categories

Tests are categorized for selective execution:
- `RequiresGPU`: Tests requiring GPU hardware
- `LongRunning`: Tests taking >1 minute
- `Integration`: Integration tests
- `Stress`: Stress and load tests
- `Performance`: Performance benchmarks

## Coverage Reporting

### Local Coverage Generation
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Generate HTML report
reportgenerator -reports:**/coverage.cobertura.xml -targetdir:coverage-report -reporttypes:Html
```

### CI Coverage
- Automatic coverage collection on all test runs
- Upload to Codecov (when token configured)
- HTML reports generated and uploaded as artifacts
- Coverage badges available

## Build Configurations

### Debug
- Full debugging symbols
- No optimizations
- Assertions enabled

### Release
- Optimizations enabled
- Trimmed symbols
- AOT-ready
- Package creation

## Platform Support

### Operating Systems
- Ubuntu (latest)
- Windows (latest)
- macOS (latest)

### .NET Versions
- .NET 9.0 (preview)

### GPU Backends (Mock Testing)
- CUDA
- OpenCL
- DirectCompute
- Metal

## Artifact Retention

- Test Results: 30 days
- Coverage Reports: 30 days
- NuGet Packages: 30 days
- Nightly Builds: 7 days
- Release Binaries: Permanent (attached to releases)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Compilation Warnings as Errors**
   - Workflows use `/p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=false`
   - Style violations suppressed with NoWarn

2. **GPU Tests Failing**
   - GPU tests run in mock mode on CI
   - Real hardware testing requires self-hosted runners

3. **AOT Compilation Issues**
   - AOT validation may fail on some platforms
   - Workflows continue on error for AOT

4. **Coverage Upload Failures**
   - Ensure CODECOV_TOKEN secret is configured
   - Check Codecov integration settings

### Manual Workflow Runs

```bash
# Trigger workflow via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run main.yml

# With inputs
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=1.0.0 -f prerelease=false
```
